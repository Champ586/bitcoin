In the test project specification there is a phrase: "At this time youâ€™ve already collected `1000 BTC`"\
It was not very clear to me, so I am ignoring this and assuming it was just for example.

You can build project with
`./mvnw clean package`

And then run it with
`java -jar target/bitcoin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`


You will need Java 11\
